Specialized screen sharing for inside sales teams. A tool that complements telephone and email. Integrated lead capture & enrichment for Wordpress.

== Description ==

CrankWheel provides **specialized screen sharing** for inside sales teams, a 3rd tool that complements telephone and email. With integrated <a href="http://crankwheel.com/instant-demos/">lead capture</a>, <a href="http://crankwheel.com/instant-demos/">lead enrichment</a> and <a href="http://crankwheel.com/instant-demos/">agent allocation</a>, CrankWheel ushers interested prospects from a companyâ€™s website to a phone call and <a href="http://crankwheel.com/screen-sharing/">screen share</a> with one of its salespeople.

== How it works? ==

The Wordpress plugin adds **Instant Demo call-to-action buttons** to your website. It allows visitors to request such a screen sharing session and will notify you about it in real time.

Presentations and broadcasting are done through **Screen Sharing**. CrankWheel can display the content of your programs, browser tabs and even clone the entire screen, enabling others to see what you see.

Stop doing what everybody else is failing at - scheduling meetings and delaying the customer from purchasing your products. By helping out within under a minute you're <a href="http://crankwheel.com/how-to-massively-increase-the-chance-of-qualifying-sales-leads/">21 times more likely to sell your product!</a>

== Use Cases ==

= Lead Capture =

Instant Demo buttons on your website open up popup forms that capture telephone and e-mail information from requesters. You receive a notification immediately after a user submits that data. That's the moment when you can call your customer, start screen sharing and even broadcast your screen on their mobile device.

= Closing Sales Online =

Some purchases can only be completed through signatures - in person. Instead of having a website that just points people to your physical location, you can now share your screen with customers, show the documents online and use an e-signature service to close more sales. Imagine how much time can be saved thanks to this!

= Classroom Broadcasting =

Having a website with a button that enables the class to join a broadcast of a lecture is pretty impressive. Add the fact that you can broadcast presentations (PowerPoint), easily switch to your browser to show online content, and more. This is a great way for offering remote lessons or presenting content without putting it up on hosting platforms that might overtake your intellectual property.

= Keynote Broadcasting =

Have you ever been seated so far away from the stage that you couldn't see the slides? We've all been there. CrankWheel is a great tool for you, the presenter, to offer your audience a chance to view slides that you're displaying on the screens they always carry on them - smartphone and laptop screens.

= Customer Success Management =

Embedding request a demo buttons throughout the website visitor's journey builds their confidence in that at any point they can request high-touch help from a real person. The ability to request that you show your customer exactly what they need to see in order to succeed has never yet been available on Wordpress!
